This project was done by Mahdi Dor Emami, utilizing the already collected dataset by **MEDMNIST v2** inteded as a final project for the "Remote Sensing, Image Data Analysis" course by Dr. Signoroni in University of Brescia UNIBS. The CNNMODEL codes belong to me and the rest belongs to the MEDMNIST for downloading the dataset. It is completely OK to use the code for any human friendly purposes!

# Cancer-Image-Classification
MedMNIST v2 cancer 2D Image Classification via CNN in TF 2.0


# Instructions:
Initially, through __main__DATA.py, we'll download and setup the data.

Then, through DATA_AUGMENT2.py, we'll augment some data relative to their inequality.

Finally, we'll use the CNNMODEL codes to run the simulations

All the codes are commented properly so there should be no worries!
